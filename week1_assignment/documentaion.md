Day 1

The objective of the day was to visually represent an emotion using a single shape and different colors. This was a simple assignment as we were getting started with p5js.

In the process of making it i began by knowing what shapes can mean joy and i found that circle will be good as it can represent bubbles( seeing buubles make it playful which can evoke a sensation of joy in human minds).
Then I created a gradient background to show a smooth transition of a colors tone from dark to light. For the circle I have used different vibrant colors and reduced the opacity to show the transparency in bubbles.

Through this excercise i got to learn about positioning and coloring of shapes.


Day 2

On day 2 I learned abot more functions like lerp() and mouseClicked(). We did basic excercises like changing colors of shapes as well as moving the shapes across the screen.

The assignment for the day was to conver the emotion to another one. I got to transform joy to peace. Here i used the the lerpColor and lerp function to transition the position and color of the the circles. At first multiple circles were scattered around the canvas to represent joy. Over time the circles converged to the center gradually changinging color to white which depicted peace.


Day 3

On day 3 I learnt aboutif else statements, for loop and some generative patterns and art. The main objective of the day was using the programming logic to create generative visuals like 10 Print.

10 print used nested for loops to create generative patterns.The basic thing was to use /,\ these paarens to make a generative looping grid.

The assignment was to learn more about 10 print like structures and what we can modify with it. I used 3D shapes by swithing to the WEBGL mode and creating a pattern with cubes and cones. The background of the canvas can be controlled ie rotated using the mouse pointer.


Day4

Learned how to insert images using loadimage(). Leant about the preload() function also. This was used to add sprites into the canvas as well as to create a random generative pattern using images. 

Learned the arrays to store multiple values which made looping easier in many cases. arrays can store large information and it can be called whenever we want. we can store informationlike position and colors in the array.

We were also introduced to  sprite sheets. using sprite sheets can make character and othe animations. It basically worked based on the looping system. 

Also learned about transformations like translate(), rotate() and scale(). It used push and pop to initialise and end the function.

The assignment was to make a flower grid using loops and transformation. This was a continuation of the activity that was did in the class.


Day5

on day 5 we learnt how to give dirctionall movement to the sprite using arrow keys. For thi looping was used to make the sprite animation and for the directional movement if else statement was used.
