# Course Documentatiom
## Day 1

The objective of the day was to visually represent an emotion using a single shape and different colors. This was a simple assignment as we were getting started with p5js.

In the process of making it i began by knowing what shapes can mean joy and i found that circle will be good as it can represent bubbles( seeing buubles make it playful which can evoke a sensation of joy in human minds).
Then I created a gradient background to show a smooth transition of a colors tone from dark to light. For the circle I have used different vibrant colors and reduced the opacity to show the transparency in bubbles.

Through this excercise i got to learn about positioning and coloring of shapes.

## Day 2

On day 2 I learned abot more functions like lerp() and mouseClicked(). We did basic excercises like changing colors of shapes as well as moving the shapes across the screen.

The assignment for the day was to conver the emotion to another one. I got to transform joy to peace. Here i used the the lerpColor and lerp function to transition the position and color of the the circles. At first multiple circles were scattered around the canvas to represent joy. Over time the circles converged to the center gradually changinging color to white which depicted peace.

## Day 3

On day 3 I learnt aboutif else statements, for loop and some generative patterns and art. The main objective of the day was using the programming logic to create generative visuals like 10 Print.

10 print used nested for loops to create generative patterns.The basic thing was to use /,\ these paarens to make a generative looping grid.

The assignment was to learn more about 10 print like structures and what we can modify with it. I used 3D shapes by swithing to the WEBGL mode and creating a pattern with cubes and cones. The background of the canvas can be controlled ie rotated using the mouse pointer.

## Day4

Learned how to insert images using loadimage(). Leant about the preload() function also. This was used to add sprites into the canvas as well as to create a random generative pattern using images. 

Learned the arrays to store multiple values which made looping easier in many cases. arrays can store large information and it can be called whenever we want. we can store informationlike position and colors in the array.

We were also introduced to  sprite sheets. using sprite sheets can make character and othe animations. It basically worked based on the looping system. 

Also learned about transformations like translate(), rotate() and scale(). It used push and pop to initialise and end the function.

The assignment was to make a flower grid using loops and transformation. This was a continuation of the activity that was did in the class.

## Day5

on day 5 we learnt how to give dirctional movement to the sprite using arrow keys. For this looping was used to make the sprite animation and for the directional movement if else statement was used.

## Weekly assignment 

The weekly assignment was to create a 30 second experience 

The topic
Showcasing and navigating Dante's Inferno, exploring the 9 layers of hell

Process

The first part was planning. for planning I had to collect and see how the different layers of hell looked like 
The images of hell was collected by generating each layer in midjourney. first i looked at how hell is described by different artists and then I gave prompts according to the visual description to midjourney. The chareacter sprite was also doenloaded from the internet.

Images were stored in arrays and and condition was given such that when the player reaches the endpoint the character get moved to the start of the screen with the changing background.

For the rain I used classes and created a vertically falling random blue strokes with varying length and speed.

Add narration: The descryption of each of dante's Inferno
End game state ie a black screen which sums up the thought of Dante on layers of hell.
Character jump animation and reverse walking animation

## Day6

### Learning

On day 6 learnt about classes and how classes can make the code more structured and neat. Classes introduces a new modularity and it is easy to manage. A class is like a blueprint That can be used it again and again in  a code.

For example while writing a code in which flowers can be spawned randomly while clicking, we can create a flower class and used it in the sketch.js. So that the flower can be repeated again and again.
